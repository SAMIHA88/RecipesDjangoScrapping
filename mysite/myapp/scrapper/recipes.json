These were super flavorful and I'll be making them again."}, {"user": "Grace", "note": 5, "comment": "I made this numerous times. The last few times, I made the falafel in the air fryer. YUM!

I cooked up dried chickpeas with a clove of garlic for 1 hour to use instead of canned chickpeas. It may need one more egg because although I was able to form them into patties... they were very fragile when flipping them in the pan when frying them.

I omitted the baking powder (other recipes don't call for it), and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. (just a personal preference).  I also cut the bread crumbs down to 3/4 cup, which was perfect.  I pan-fried in olive oil the first time, and baked them at 450 on parchment paper for 20 minutes (flipping after 10 minutes) the second time, which was healthier.  Thanks for the recipe!"}, {"user": "Robert Maeda", "note": 3, "comment": "The recipe makes pretty tasty falafel.  The sauce is also quick and delicious.  However, making them really left a mess.  These falafel are extremely fragile. I made the mistake of trying to make slightly smaller patties and cooking them in batches. But as I was flipping them, a couple fragmented and made a mess of my oil.  When the small pieces started to burn, I had to start a new pot of oil.  Deep frying is already messy.  WIth two pots of oil, it is even worse.  I probably will try a different recipe next time, but the sauce will be probably be remade."}, {"user": "MoJo Rising", "note": 5, "comment": "I followed heavensnt86 suggestions and they turned out fantastic!"}, {"user": "mawieee", "note": 5, "comment": "I love this recipe and so does my husband!!
